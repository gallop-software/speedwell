It includes everything you need — code editor, AI assistant, Git, terminal, media manager, font manager, SEO & structured data scanner, and a template marketplace — all in one window with nothing to configure.

It was purpose-built for this workflow, whether you're a complete beginner or an advanced Next.js developer who wants AI-assisted development:

| | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Best for** | Non-programmers, junior programmers, advanced programmers |
| **AI built in** | Claude AI ready to go — just enter your API key |
| **Template browser** | Built-in marketplace |
| **Media manager** | Built-in Studio with CDN sync |
| **Font manager** | Built-in Studio with WOFF2 font generation |
| **SEO Audit** | Analyze SEO & Structured Data |
| **Git** | Git UI with modal diff viewer |
| **Node.js** | Built-in installer and version manager |
| **Deployment** | Connect Vercel or Cloudflare, then let AI deploy for you |

[![Download Gallop AI Editor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download_Gallop_AI_Editor-166534?style=for-the-badge)](https://gallop.software/)

Available for Mac and Windows.

#### Step 1: Install Gallop AI Editor

1. Go to [gallop.software](https://gallop.software/) and download the installer for your platform
2. Open the installer and follow the prompts
3. Launch the Gallop AI Editor
4. If prompted, the editor will walk you through installing Node.js automatically — just follow the on-screen steps

#### Step 2: Create Your Project

Open the **New Project** modal. It has three tabs — **Gallop Templates**, **Git Repositories**, and **Local** — and you want the first one.

1. On the **Gallop Templates** tab, select **Speedwell** from the gallery
2. Name your new repository, and pick which GitHub account or organization owns it
3. Choose whether it's public or private
4. Pick the folder on your computer where it should live
5. Click create

The editor then does everything else in one pass:

- **Creates your own repository on GitHub** from the template — a clean repo that belongs to you, with no shared history tying it back to the original
- **Clones it to your machine** in the folder you picked, with a progress bar
- **Opens it as a project**, ready to run

Because the repository is created here, **your GitHub repo already exists** by the time you reach [Put Your Site Online](#put-your-site-online) — there's nothing to set up on GitHub when it's time to deploy.

> **Why this is one click:** you're already signed in to GitHub inside the editor, so it can create the repository on your behalf without asking you for anything.

#### Step 3: Start Your Site

Click the **play icon** in the left rail (or press `Cmd+1`) to open the **Start Website** view. It's a terminal with a toolbar across the top — two clicks and your site is live locally.

1. Click **Install** and wait for it to finish. This downloads everything the project needs, and takes a minute or two the first time.
2. Click **Start Website**. Your site is now running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
3. Click the **globe icon** in the top-right title bar to open your site in a browser. Hover it and it tells you the port it's running on.

Here's the full toolbar, and the command each button saves you from typing:

| Button | What it does | Equivalent command |
|---|---|---|
| **Install** / **Reinstall** | Downloads the project's dependencies. Reads **Reinstall** once they're already installed. | `npm install` |
| **Start Website** | Starts the development server with hot reload — save a file and the browser updates itself. | `npm run dev` |
| **Stop** | Shuts the server down and frees up the port. Replaces **Start Website** while the site is running. | `Ctrl+C` |
| **Refresh Cache** | Clears Next.js's build cache and restarts the server. Only appears while running. | delete `.next`, restart |
| **Clear** | Wipes the terminal output. Doesn't touch the server. | `clear` |

The play icon in the left rail turns **green with a dot** while your site is running, so you can tell at a glance from any view.

**Leave the server running while you work.** You only need **Start Website** once per session — the site refreshes on its own every time you or the AI saves a file.

**If something looks stuck** — a change won't appear, or the site won't load — try **Refresh Cache** first, and **Stop** then **Start Website** if that doesn't do it.

#### Step 4: Chat with AI

Press `Cmd+J` to show the AI panel on the right. Click the **+** in its header and you'll get a picker with three cards:

| Card | What it is |
|---|---|
| **AI Chat** | Gallop's own chat interface — message bubbles, plan mode, and the target for screenshots you insert. Start here. |
| **Claude Code** | Claude Code itself, running as a terminal inside the panel. |
| **Terminal** | A plain shell, for when you want to run something yourself. |

**Both AI options are Claude Code.** Gallop's AI Chat runs Claude Code under the hood and puts a friendlier interface on top of it; the Claude Code card gives you the same engine as its normal terminal interface. Same capabilities, same access to your project — pick whichever you find easier to read.

- **New to this?** Use **AI Chat**. Answers render as formatted text, file changes are easier to follow, and screenshots insert straight into the conversation.
- **Already use Claude Code?** Use the **Claude Code** card. Everything works the way you're used to, including slash commands and your existing habits.

You can run both at once in separate tabs — they're independent sessions.

Pick **AI Chat**, then just ask:

```
I'm new to this. Help me customize this website for my business.
```

The AI assistant can read and edit your project files, run commands, and explain anything you're confused about. Just describe what you want in plain English:

```
Change the homepage heading to Welcome to My Bakery
```

```
Make the accent color pink
```

```
Add a new page called Services
```

```
Optimize the SEO on my homepage
```

**Tip:** Press `Cmd+Shift+S` to take a screenshot of your running site and attach it to the chat. The AI can see exactly what you see and suggest changes visually.

## Working in the Editor

Everything below is how you actually build your site day to day. The left rail switches between views; each has a keyboard shortcut.

| Icon | View | Shortcut | What it's for |
|---|---|---|---|
| ▶ | **Start Website** | `Cmd+1` | Run your site locally. Install, Start, Stop, Refresh Cache — see [Step 3](#step-3-start-your-site). Turns green while running. |
| ⑂ | **Source Control** | `Cmd+2` | Commit, branch, and merge visually. The badge shows how many files changed. |
| `<>` | **Editor** | `Cmd+3` | The code editor, with autocomplete and go-to-definition. `Cmd+B` toggles the file explorer. |
| 🖼 | **Studio** | `Cmd+4` | Your images and fonts — see below. |
| 🌐 | **SEO** | `Cmd+5` | Scan any page for SEO and structured-data problems. |
| 🚀 | **Publish** | `Cmd+6` | Connect Cloudflare, Vercel, and Mailgun so AI can deploy for you. |

`Cmd+K` cycles forward through views if you'd rather not remember numbers.

### The AI Panel

The AI panel lives on the right and is where most of your work happens.

- `Cmd+J` shows and hides it. Hiding does **not** stop what's running — a long AI task keeps going while the panel is closed.
- `Cmd+I` expands it to fill the window, for when you're reading a long answer.
- `Cmd+T` opens a new tab; `Cmd+Shift+[` and `Cmd+Shift+]` cycle between them. You can drag tabs to reorder them.
- Every tab has a `×`. Close the last one and you're back at the AI Chat / Claude Code / Terminal picker.

**Agent mode vs Plan mode** — on an AI Chat tab, press `Cmd+.` to switch between them. (Claude Code tabs have their own mode controls, so `Cmd+.` doesn't apply there.)

| Mode | Behavior | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent** | AI edits your files directly. | You trust the change — most of the time. |
| **Plan** | AI describes what it intends to do and waits for your approval. | The change is large or you want to learn what it's doing. |

Two AI Chat slash commands are worth knowing: `/new` starts a fresh conversation, and `/compact` summarizes a long one so you can keep going without losing the thread.

**Which AI you're using** is set in the panel's settings gear: **Gallop AI** (prepaid balance, nothing to configure), **Your API Key** (bring your own Anthropic key), or **Subscription** (your existing Claude login). Sessions pick up the setting when they start, so change it *before* opening a chat tab.

### Showing AI What You See

Describing a visual bug is hard. Show it instead.

- `Cmd+Shift+S` — drag a box around any part of your running site. The capture opens in an annotator where you can draw arrows and boxes, then **Insert** it straight into a chat tab.
- `Cmd+Shift+G` — opens the code file behind whatever page your browser is showing. No hunting through folders to find which file draws a page.
- `Cmd+Shift+L` — drops the file you're editing into the chat as a reference, so you can say "fix the spacing here" without explaining where "here" is.

### Studio: Images and Fonts

`Cmd+4` opens Studio, which manages everything in your `public/` folder.

- Drop in images and it generates thumbnails and blur placeholders automatically
- Crop and edit without leaving the editor
- Push assets to a CDN so they load fast worldwide
- Drop in a font and it converts to WOFF2, the format browsers load fastest

Studio keeps its records in `_data/_studio.json`. That file is generated — let Studio manage it.

### SEO

`Cmd+5` runs three checks on any page: on-page SEO (titles and descriptions, with a rating on whether each is too short or too long), a comparison of what search engines see versus what loads in the browser, and validation of your structured data.

Ask AI to fix what it finds:

```
Run the SEO report on my homepage and fix everything it flags
```

### Source Control

`Cmd+2` gives you Git without the command line — stage individual lines, review diffs side by side, and browse history. If you'd rather not think about Git at all, don't: ask AI to "commit my changes and push them."

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd+1`–`Cmd+6` | Switch views |
| `Cmd+K` | Cycle views forward |
| `Cmd+J` | Show/hide the AI panel |
| `Cmd+I` | Expand/collapse the AI panel |
| `Cmd+.` | Toggle agent ↔ plan mode |
| `Cmd+T` | New tab |
| `Cmd+W` | Close tab |
| `Cmd+Shift+[` / `]` | Cycle tabs |
| `Cmd+B` | Toggle file explorer |
| `Cmd+P` | Quick Open — jump to any file by name |
| `Cmd+F` | Find |
| `Cmd+Shift+F` | Find in all files |
| `Cmd+S` | Save |
| `Cmd+Shift+S` | Screenshot |
| `Cmd+Shift+G` | Open the route file for your browser's page |
| `Cmd+Shift+L` | Send the current file to chat |
| `Cmd+Shift+N` | New window |

On Windows, use `Ctrl` wherever this says `Cmd`.

## Put Your Site Online

Your code is already on GitHub — you're signed in inside the editor, and your repository was created when you started the project. All that's left is a free hosting account: either [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com).

### The Easy Way: Let AI Deploy It

Press `Cmd+6` (the rocket icon) to open the **Publish** view. It has a tab for each service you might need:

| Tab | What it's for |
|---|---|
| **Cloudflare** | Deploy to Cloudflare Workers |
| **Vercel** | Deploy to Vercel |
| **Mailgun** | Sends the email from your contact form |

Each tab links straight to the page where you generate the token, with the right permissions preselected — you paste it in, click **Connect** to verify it, then **Save**.

From then on the editor injects those credentials into your terminal and AI chat automatically, so the assistant can deploy on your behalf and **you never paste a token into a project file**.

> **Important:** credentials are handed to a session when it starts. After saving a new token, open a **new** chat or terminal tab — an existing one won't see it.

Then just ask:

```
Push my latest changes to GitHub and deploy this site
```

The AI will walk you through every step. When you're done, your site will be live with a URL you can share.

Already know which host you want? Use the ready-made prompt for [Vercel](#deploy-to-vercel) or [Cloudflare](#deploy-to-cloudflare-workers).

### Deploy to Vercel

Connect your Vercel account in the Gallop AI Editor, then paste this into the AI chat:

```
Deploy this site to Vercel. My Vercel account is already connected.

Please:
1. Push my latest changes to GitHub
2. Link this project to Vercel and deploy it to production
3. Ask me for my Mailgun values, then add them as environment variables
   (see .env.production.sample for the full list)
4. Tell me the live URL when it's done

Never commit .env.production — it holds real secrets.
```

Vercel redeploys automatically every time you push, so from here on your changes go live by asking the AI to push them.

**Environment variables, without the busywork.** The Vercel tab in the Publish view can push and pull your `.env` files against your Vercel project directly. Change a value locally, push it up; pull production values down to check them. It shows you a full diff before anything is written, and backs up your local file before a pull.

Congratulations! Your site is now live to the world. Share your new URL and start growing your business online. Ready for a custom domain? See [Vercel's domain setup guide](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains).

### Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

Prefer Cloudflare? Speedwell also runs on Cloudflare Workers via the [OpenNext](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare) adapter. See it live: **[speedwell-cloudflare.gallop.software](https://speedwell-cloudflare.gallop.software/)** — the same template, deployed exactly the way this section describes.

**Step 1 — Connect Cloudflare in the Publish view** (`Cmd+6`). Once saved, the editor puts your Cloudflare credentials (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`) into the terminal environment and makes them available to the AI chat. Wrangler reads those variables automatically, which means **nobody has to run `npx wrangler login`, and no token is ever pasted into a file.**

**Step 2 — Paste this prompt into the AI chat:**

```
Deploy this site to Cloudflare Workers. My Cloudflare account is already
connected, so CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN and CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID are in the
terminal environment — do not run `wrangler login`.

Please:
1. Run `npm run cf:setup` to create .env.production from the sample
2. Ask me for my production URL and Mailgun values, then fill in .env.production
3. Run `npm run cf:deploy` to build and create the Worker
4. Run `npm run cf:secrets` to upload the secrets
5. Tell me the live URL when it's done

Never commit .env.production — it holds real secrets.
```

The AI will pause at step 2 to collect your values. Everything else runs unattended. First deploy takes a few minutes.

**Step 3 — Follow-up prompts** for anything after the first deploy:

```
Deploy my latest changes to Cloudflare
```

```
I changed my Mailgun API key in .env.production — push the updated secrets to Cloudflare
```

```
Rename my Cloudflare Worker to my-business-site and redeploy
```

```
My contact form isn't sending email on Cloudflare — check my secrets are set correctly
```

**If a prompt fails,** paste the error back into the chat. The most common causes are a Cloudflare account that isn't connected yet (so wrangler has no credentials) and running `cf:secrets` before the Worker exists — the AI can diagnose both from the error text.

#### Reference: How the Cloudflare Deployment Works

Everything below is **reference material for your AI assistant** — what files Cloudflare needs, which ones get created, and what has to change when you rename things. You don't need to read or run any of it yourself; the prompts above cover the whole process. It's here so the AI has accurate ground truth, and so you have something to point at if a deploy goes wrong.

##### The Three Kinds of Cloudflare Files

Speedwell ships Cloudflare-ready. **If you forked or generated this repo, every config file already exists — you do not create any of them.** The only file you add by hand is `.env.production`.

**1. Config files — already in the repo, keep them**

| File | What it does for Cloudflare |
|---|---|
| `wrangler.jsonc` | The Worker manifest. Names the Worker, points at the build output, declares bindings and the `nodejs_compat` flag. Wrangler reads this on every command. |
| `open-next.config.ts` | Tells the OpenNext adapter how to convert the Next.js build into a Worker. Ships minimal — ISR/R2 caching is commented out and off. |
| `next.config.mjs` | Its last line calls `initOpenNextCloudflareForDev()`, which makes Cloudflare bindings available during `npm run dev`. It is a no-op in production builds, so **this does not break Vercel**. |
| `package.json` | Holds the `cf:*` scripts plus `@opennextjs/cloudflare` and `wrangler` as devDependencies. |
| `.env.production.sample` | Placeholder copy of the secrets you'll need. Safe to commit — it contains no real values. |

**2. Files you create — never committed**

| File | How to create it | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `.env.production` | `npm run cf:setup` (copies the sample) | Real secret values. `npm run cf:secrets` reads this file and uploads its contents to Cloudflare's secret store. |
| `.dev.vars` | Created automatically by `npm run cf:preview` | Local-preview copy of your secrets, the format the Workers runtime expects. |

Both are covered by the `.env*` and `.dev.vars*` rules in `.gitignore`, so they stay out of Git automatically. **Never commit either one.**

**3. Build output — generated, never commit**

| Path | Created by |
|---|---|
| `.open-next/` | `npm run cf:build` — contains `worker.js` and the static `assets/` that `wrangler.jsonc` points at |
| `.wrangler/` | Wrangler's local state and cache |
| `cloudflare-env.d.ts` | `npm run cf:typegen` — TypeScript types for your bindings |

All three are already gitignored. `.open-next/` does not exist until you build, which is why `cf:deploy` and `cf:preview` always run the build first.

##### The Deployment Sequence

This is what the AI runs on your behalf, in this order:

```bash
npm run cf:setup     # scaffolds .env.production
# fill in .env.production with your values
npm run cf:deploy    # build + deploy — creates the Worker on first run
npm run cf:secrets   # push .env.production to the Worker's secret store (after the Worker exists)
```

No `wrangler login` step is needed: connecting Cloudflare in the editor already put `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in the environment, and wrangler picks it up automatically.

Order matters: `cf:secrets` cannot create a Worker, so deploy once first. After that, secrets and code are independent — you only re-run `cf:secrets` when a value changes, and every later deploy reuses them.

**How `cf:secrets` finds the right Worker:** it runs `wrangler secret bulk .env.production`, which targets your authenticated Cloudflare account plus the Worker named in `wrangler.jsonc` — no URL involved. It uploads *every* key in the file, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_URL` included; that one is harmless as a secret but has no effect, because `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined at build time rather than read at runtime.

- **Authenticate first.** Either set `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in your environment (what the Gallop AI Editor does for you when you connect Cloudflare) or run `npx wrangler login` for OAuth, cached in `~/.wrangler`. If your account can't be inferred from the token, also set `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`. Wrangler ships as a dev dependency, so `npx` runs the local copy — no global install needed. Without auth, `cf:secrets` and `cf:deploy` can't reach Cloudflare.
- **Names must match.** The `name` in `wrangler.jsonc` must equal the Worker's actual name in your dashboard. If a Git-connected deploy created it under a different name, update `wrangler.jsonc` to match — otherwise `cf:secrets` pushes to a nonexistent Worker.

##### Renaming the Worker

`wrangler.jsonc` ships with the Worker named `speedwell`. If you rename it, **two values must change together**:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "your-site-name",           // ← 1. the Worker name
  "services": [
    {
      "binding": "WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE",
      "service": "your-site-name"     // ← 2. must be identical to "name"
    }
  ]
}
```

`WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE` is how the Worker calls itself, which OpenNext relies on. If the two strings drift apart, the deploy succeeds and the site fails at runtime — a confusing failure worth avoiding.

##### Git-Connected Builds

If you connect the repo in the Cloudflare dashboard instead of deploying from your machine:

- **Build command:** `npm run cf:build`
- **Deploy command:** `npx opennextjs-cloudflare deploy` (the same command `npm run cf:deploy` uses)
- **Build variables:** set `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_URL` here. Anything prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_` is inlined into the JavaScript at build time, so it must exist as a *build* variable — a runtime secret is too late.
- **Secrets:** `MAILGUN_*` values are read at runtime, so `npm run cf:secrets` (or the dashboard's secret UI) covers them. They do not belong in build variables.

Custom domains live under the Worker's **Settings → Domains & Routes**.

##### Workers Runtime Constraints

Workers is not Node.js, and two limits shape how you write code for it:

- **There is no filesystem.** `fs.readFileSync(process.cwd() + '/_data/...')` does not throw on Workers — it silently returns empty, so your content vanishes with no error. Always import generated JSON through the `@/data/*` alias so it is bundled at build time. This is an enforced Canon rule; see `CLAUDE.md`.
- **`nodejs_compat` is required.** The flag in `wrangler.jsonc` provides the Node APIs Next.js expects. Removing it breaks the build.

##### Quick Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run cf:setup` | Scaffold `.env.production` from the sample |
| `npm run cf:build` | Regenerate blog data, then build the Worker into `.open-next/` |
| `npm run cf:preview` | Build and run the real Workers runtime locally |
| `npm run cf:deploy` | Build and deploy to Cloudflare |
| `npm run cf:upload` | Build and upload a new Worker version without making it live (staged rollouts) |
| `npm run cf:secrets` | Push `.env.production` to the Worker's secret store |
| `npm run cf:typegen` | Regenerate `cloudflare-env.d.ts` from your bindings |
