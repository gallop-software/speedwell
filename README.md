## About Gallop Templates

Speedwell is part of the [Gallop](https://gallop.software) template ecosystem, built for [Cursor](https://cursor.com) and Claude AI. Cursor is Gallop's preferred AI programming editor, purpose-built for coding with AI. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) works too, but Cursor's native Claude integration makes development faster and more intuitive.

**Why Claude?** Claude is the premier coding AI agent. It understands context better, writes cleaner code, and handles complex multi-file changes that other AI models struggle with. When you chat with Claude in Cursor, you're working with the best AI pair programmer available.

### Gallop Canon: AI Guardrails

Every Gallop template includes `@gallop.software/canon`, a system of ESLint rules and AI instructions that keep Claude on track. Canon ensures:

- **Consistent architecture** - Claude follows the same patterns across your entire codebase
- **No breaking changes** - Guardrails prevent AI from introducing common mistakes
- **Faster development** - Claude already knows the project structure, components, and conventions
- **Quality code** - Enforced best practices for performance, SEO, AI discoverability, and maintainability

Think of Canon as training wheels that never come off. Claude stays within proven patterns, so you get reliable results every time.

**Canon Commands:**

- `npm run check` - Run lint, TypeScript, and unused checks together
- `npm run generate:ai-rules` - Regenerate AI rules from Canon
- `npm run update:canon` - Update to latest Canon version

### Built for SEO and AI Discoverability

This template was crafted from the ground up to get your business website ranked #1 on Google and mentioned by AI assistants like ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. The software architecture, semantic HTML structure, metadata system, and structured data are optimized for both search engine crawlers and AI models that recommend businesses to users.

AI mentions are becoming more important than traditional SEO. When someone asks an AI assistant for recommendations, you want your business in that answer. Gallop templates are built with the structured data and semantic markup that AI models rely on to understand and recommend your business. Businesses using this template are already ranking on Google and getting discovered by AI assistants.

### What You Can Build

- **Build websites with AI** - Let AI do the technical heavy lifting while you provide instructions
- **Skip the boring work** - Let AI help write your content, optimize your SEO, and handle tedious page updates
- **Pixel-perfect design** - TailwindCSS integration for rapid development without leaving component files
- **Automate workflows** - AI-powered scripts for sitewide SEO and AI discoverability improvements, image regeneration, and content updates
- **Get found online** - Battle-tested foundation with structured data for search engines and AI assistants that recommend businesses
- **Deploy instantly** - Next.js architecture on Vercel for cheap, fast hosting

### Built by Industry Veterans

The [team](https://webplant.media) behind Gallop has decades of combined experience building websites, apps, and web applications for top global brands. We've helped businesses achieve #1 Google rankings in competitive markets and understand what it takes to build world class business websites.
