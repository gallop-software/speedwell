This urban rooftop transformation created an outdoor oasis with panoramic city views. We designed multiple zones including a dining area with pergola for shade, a lounge space with weather-resistant sectional seating, and a compact kitchenette for outdoor entertaining. Composite decking provides a low-maintenance surface that withstands the elements while maintaining a natural wood appearance.

Container gardens with native plants add greenery and privacy screening without requiring extensive infrastructure. String lights and lanterns create magical evening ambiance, while a portable fire feature extends the usable season. Weatherproof storage benches conceal cushions and accessories when not in use. The design maximizes every square foot of this premium outdoor space while addressing wind, sun exposure, and building regulations.
