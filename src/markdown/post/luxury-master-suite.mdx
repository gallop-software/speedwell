This expansive master suite renovation created a five-star hotel experience within a private residence. We designed a sophisticated bedroom retreat with a custom upholstered headboard wall, blackout drapery with sheer underlays, and a sitting area perfect for morning coffee. Rich jewel tones in navy and emerald are balanced with warm metallics and plush textures.

The ensuite bathroom features a freestanding soaking tub positioned beneath a statement chandelier, a spacious walk-in shower with body jets, and dual vanities with backlit mirrors. Heated marble floors, a built-in sound system, and automated lighting complete the spa-like atmosphere. The adjoining walk-in closet offers custom organization systems and a dedicated dressing area.
