This eco-conscious home design prioritizes sustainability without compromising style or comfort. We specified reclaimed wood flooring, low-VOC paints, and furnishings from certified sustainable sources. Energy-efficient systems include solar panels, smart thermostats, LED lighting throughout, and high-performance windows that minimize heat transfer. A whole-home water filtration system and low-flow fixtures reduce water consumption.

Natural materials including cork, bamboo, and organic textiles create a healthy indoor environment while reducing the home's carbon footprint. We incorporated abundant natural light, strategic cross-ventilation, and a living plant wall that improves air quality. The design demonstrates that environmental responsibility and beautiful, livable interiors are not mutually exclusive. Every material and system was selected to minimize environmental impact while maximizing longevity and performance.
