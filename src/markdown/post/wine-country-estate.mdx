This sprawling wine country estate design marries rustic elegance with refined comfort, creating a sophisticated retreat for entertaining and relaxation. Exposed wood beams, stone fireplaces, and wide-plank oak floors establish the foundational character, while custom furnishings in rich leathers and natural linens add warmth. The great room opens to expansive vineyard views through French doors and oversized windows.

A chef's kitchen features professional appliances, a large island for casual dining, and a separate butler's pantry. The wine cellar was custom-designed with climate control and display storage for an extensive collection. Throughout the home, we balanced the grandeur of the architecture with intimate gathering spaces. Natural materials, earth-toned palette, and thoughtful details create a seamless connection to the surrounding landscape and agricultural heritage.
