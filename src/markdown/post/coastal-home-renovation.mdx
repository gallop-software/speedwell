This stunning coastal residence received a complete interior makeover that celebrates its beachfront location. We embraced a fresh, airy aesthetic with a soft color palette of whites, blues, and natural textures. The renovation included opening up the main living areas to capture ocean views, installing custom built-in cabinetry for seamless storage, and selecting durable yet elegant materials that can withstand the coastal climate. Shiplap walls, whitewashed oak floors, and linen furnishings create a relaxed sophistication perfect for seaside living.

Our design incorporated sustainable materials and energy-efficient systems while maintaining the home's timeless appeal. Every detail was considered to enhance the connection between indoor and outdoor spaces.
