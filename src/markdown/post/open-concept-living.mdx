This whole-home renovation centered on removing walls to create a flowing open-concept layout perfect for modern family living. The kitchen, dining, and living areas now form one cohesive space with distinct zones defined by furniture placement, lighting, and material changes. A large kitchen island serves as the central hub, providing seating, storage, and workspace while maintaining visual connection throughout.

We maintained spatial definition through a consistent design language while varying textures and ceiling treatments. The result is an airy, light-filled space that feels generous yet intimate. Floor-to-ceiling windows and glass doors were added to enhance the indoor-outdoor connection. Strategic built-in storage and concealed utility areas keep the open space organized and clutter-free.
