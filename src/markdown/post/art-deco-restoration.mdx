This historic apartment restoration celebrates the glamour of Art Deco design while incorporating modern systems and amenities. We meticulously restored original details including geometric moldings, terrazzo floors, and brass fixtures, while introducing period-appropriate elements where originals were lost. The color palette of black, gold, emerald, and cream evokes the elegance of the 1920s and 30s.

Custom furniture pieces feature the bold geometric patterns and luxurious materials characteristic of the era, including lacquered wood, velvet upholstery, and mirrored surfaces. We sourced vintage light fixtures and commissioned reproductions of iconic Art Deco designs. Modern conveniences like updated plumbing, electrical, and HVAC were seamlessly integrated behind the restored architecture. The result is a stunning example of period design that functions beautifully for contemporary living.
