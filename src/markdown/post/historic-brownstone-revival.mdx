This 19th-century brownstone required a delicate balance of historic preservation and modern functionality. We meticulously restored original architectural details including crown molding, hardwood floors, and ornate fireplace mantels while updating the space for contemporary living. The design honors the home's Victorian heritage through rich jewel tones, vintage-inspired lighting, and carefully selected antique pieces, while modern amenities and open sightlines ensure comfort and livability. Custom millwork blends seamlessly with original features, and a sophisticated color palette highlights the home's architectural beauty.

Every room tells a story of thoughtful restoration, from the grand entrance foyer with its restored staircase to the chef's kitchen that respects the home's character while providing state-of-the-art functionality.
