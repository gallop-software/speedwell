This 1960s home received a thoughtful refresh that honors its midcentury modern architecture while updating finishes and functionality for contemporary living. We restored original features including terrazzo floors, picture windows, and the dramatic floating staircase, complementing them with period-appropriate furnishings and lighting fixtures. The color palette of warm woods, burnt orange, and avocado green pays homage to the era.

We updated the kitchen and bathrooms with modern fixtures that respect the home's aesthetic, including walnut cabinetry and geometric tile patterns. The open floor plan was enhanced with new built-in storage and a reconstructed fireplace feature wall. Iconic furniture pieces from Eames, Saarinen, and Wegner complete the authentic midcentury feel while providing comfortable, functional living spaces.
