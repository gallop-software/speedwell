      <Quote>We absolutely loved our experience at Heartbeat. Each prenatal appointment leading up to the birth I felt 100% supported and cared for. As a first time mom, I had lots of questions, and they were so gracious to answer every one and never make me feel bad about asking so many. Their entire staff is warm and welcoming. I was lucky enough to have Carmen, Shianne, and Ellie at my birth at one point, and they all made me feel safe and supported! Their intentional care continued through the several appointments I had postpartum as well! If we are in the Lubbock area for baby #2, we will absolutely use Heartbeat again.</Quote>

      <Quote>We had both our babies at heartbeat and could not recommend it enough! The midwives took such good care of us and welcomed us with open arms! Sofi always greeted us with a smile and a positive attitude! They made us feel like family! Carmen and Kelly delivered my last baby and it was such a peaceful experience. These ladies really care for their patients! We hope to be back for our next baby!</Quote>

      <Quote>The people at Heartbeat Midwifery are the sweetest ladies ever, so kind and considerate and were there for every question and concern I had. They were so helpful in giving advice on supplements to take and what foods to eat to support my pregnancy and birth and it made a huge difference! At my birth they were so reassuring and knew exactly what they were doing and I have never felt so seen and cared for. My baby was born beautiful and healthy and that is thanks to them. As a first time Mom I couldn't have done this without all of their great support! I would 100% recommend then to anyone!</Quote>

      <Quote>These women are an absolute Godsend! I delivered my rainbow baby here in January and they were the greatest care team I could ever ask for. This was my second birth center birth but first with them and I will definitely be back if we have anymore children. My husband and I both loved the atmosphere and the level of care we received. All of the midwives helped put my mind at ease all the way from start to finish. I was an anxious momma this pregnancy having a loss just a few months prior, They were quick to provide me books and supplements to help with my anxieties. Carmen and Ellie were present for my delivery. Both of them were rockstars helping me and baby both stay calm during the chaos of labor. My son's heart rate dropped during the end of labor and both of them were great at bringing me back to a good head space and helping me safely and quickly bring him into the world. The worst part of our care with them was saying Goodbye at our last appointment. From the office staff to midwives every single person we interacted with during our time with them was phenomenal.</Quote>

      <Paragraph textAlign="text-left">"We have read the book "Gentle Birth". We wanted to find a place that agrees birthing is essentially a natural process rather than a medical event. At the same time we can make sure we are taken care of by professionals and be told and prepared if any medical intervention needed. Heartbeat serves the needs perfectly. They give helpful advices all the way through, and they caught our son in the parking lot. (They caught baby anywhere and anytime.) When working with them, we know we can trust them."</Paragraph>

Carmen and all the other amazing midwives and students that have seen their way through Heartbeat have been a part of each of our incredible journeys. We are beyond thankful for the relationships made while bringing our babies earth side. We are thankful for the support beyond just pregnancy and birth. We can't recommend Heartbeat enough. I know that had we not had the support from a very knowledgeable and experienced midwife my birthing experiences would've been much different."</Paragraph>

All the midwives were amazing to work with. They answered any and all questions I had and had all kinds of remedies and recommendations. I delivered my first baby here in October and I felt so empowered and supported during my birth. My midwives were fantastic coaches every step of the way. I 100% recommend Heartbeat Midwifery. My husband and I will definitely deliver here again with any future babies we have!"</Paragraph>
