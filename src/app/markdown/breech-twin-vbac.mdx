    Experience That Makes the Difference
  </Heading>
  <Paragraph>When it comes to breech babies, twins, or VBAC journeys, too often the conversation jumps straight to surgery. At Heartbeat Midwifery, we honor a different way—a path grounded in personalized care, trust, and evidence-based midwifery practices that center your unique story.</Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>We walk alongside you through every step: monitoring baby's position and growth, supporting your body's natural wisdom, and offering guidance tailored just for you. Whether encouraging optimal alignment for a breech baby, closely watching twin pregnancies, or supporting your dream for a vaginal birth after cesarean, we bring experience, gentle confidence, and deep respect for your choices.</Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>Not every midwife is equipped for these special births, but at Heartbeat, this is our expertise and passion. And if your journey calls for hospital care, we'll help you find a team who shares your values—so you're never without informed, compassionate support.</Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>No matter how your path unfolds—breech, twins, VBAC, or all three—we're here to hold your hand with clarity, compassion, and unwavering support.</Paragraph>
