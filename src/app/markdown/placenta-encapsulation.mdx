    <Heading as="h2" id="services" className="text-center">Why Consider Placenta Encapsulation?</Heading>
    <Paragraph>This beautiful ritual honors your placenta—the incredible organ that nourished your baby throughout pregnancy—by preparing it with loving care through steaming, dehydrating, and encapsulating. While research is still unfolding, many mothers share stories of steadier moods, more sustained energy, and enriched milk supply in the weeks after birth.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>Whether you birth at home or in our welcoming birth center, your placenta is handled safely and hygienically, returning to you as capsules you can take throughout your postpartum recovery. It's a natural way to honor your body's journey and support your wellbeing during a time of immense transition.</Paragraph>

    <Heading as="h3">Your Choice, Your Care</Heading>

    <Paragraph>At Heartbeat Midwifery, we believe postpartum care is just as sacred as birth itself. Offering placenta encapsulation is one of the many ways we hold space for your healing, honoring your body, your experience, and your unique path into parenthood.</Paragraph>
