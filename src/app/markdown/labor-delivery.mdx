        Nitrous Oxide for Labor & Delivery
      </Heading>
      <Quote>Sometimes, a little extra support can make all the difference.</Quote>
      <Paragraph>At Heartbeat Midwifery, we offer nitrous oxide—a gentle, on-demand option to help ease pain and reduce anxiety during labor. Often called "laughing gas," this natural-leaning option can help you stay grounded, calm, and more in control during intense contractions, without affecting your baby or your ability to move freely.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>You hold the mask, and you're in charge—breathing it in as needed, moment by moment. It's there if you want it, and always offered with thoughtful guidance from your midwife, who will help ensure it supports your comfort while honoring the flow of your birth.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>As always, your preferences lead the way.</Paragraph>

        Water Birth
      </Heading>
      <Quote>There's something deeply instinctive about giving birth in water—soft, soothing, and supported.</Quote>
      <Paragraph>We are honored to offer safe, natural water birth options—whether in one of our spacious, spa-inspired tubs at the birth center or in the quiet comfort of your own home. For many families, water brings ease, calm, and a feeling of gentle protection. It helps the body open and the mind rest, allowing labor to unfold with more softness and trust.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Often called "nature's epidural," water has a way of melting tension, easing the intensity of contractions, and reducing anxiety. The buoyancy lightens your body, supports freedom of movement, and encourages you to follow your instincts—finding the positions and rhythms that feel right in your bones.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Our midwives are highly trained and experienced in water birth, and we're here to walk with you every step of the way—offering presence, guidance, and unwavering care. Whether you're planning a peaceful center birth or a sacred birth at home, we'll help you create a birth that feels both gentle and powerful.</Paragraph>

        The Golden Hour: A Sacred Pause Between Hearts
      </Heading>
      <Paragraph>In the quiet stillness after birth, when the world softens and time seems to slow, you and your baby enter a sacred space—a moment held gently between two beating hearts.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>At Heartbeat Midwifery, we honor this fragile, profound hour with deep reverence. We practice delayed cord clamping, allowing nature's wisdom to flow uninterrupted. We cradle you both in immediate skin-to-skin, where warmth, breath, and heartbeat become a lifeline of connection. And we hold space for uninterrupted breastfeeding, nurturing not just nourishment, but trust and calm in this first dance of motherhood.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>This golden hour is more than minutes on a clock—it's a whispered promise, a tender beginning, a sacred pause where your journey together truly begins.</Paragraph>
