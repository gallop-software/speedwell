As full as our days get, our hearts are even more full. Busy days overflowing with brave women and the families who love them so well. We see the months of discomfort, hours to days of hard labor and the weeks of recovery; sleepless nights and sacrificing for the tiniest people. The work of family. We see men become dads and women become moms—moments that change us and memories we tuck in our hearts forever. We are left thanking our heavenly Father for his grace in putting us here to be part of such good work. It is an unforgettable joy. Thank you for 2021.
