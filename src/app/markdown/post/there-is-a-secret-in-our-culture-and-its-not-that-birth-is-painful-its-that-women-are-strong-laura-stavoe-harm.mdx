Today, on International Day of the Midwife, our hearts are full. To be midwives is to be invited into the most vulnerable, powerful, sacred moments of another’s life. Together, we don’t just catch babies—we catch tears, laughter, strength, and transformation. We hold hands, hold space, and hold our breath as new souls take their first.It’s long nights, whispered prayers, shared stories, and fierce advocacy. It’s believing in the strength of every mother—especially when she forgets it. This isn’t just what we do. It’s who we are.To every family we’ve walked beside—you’ve changed us, too. This is holy work, and we are honored every single day.
