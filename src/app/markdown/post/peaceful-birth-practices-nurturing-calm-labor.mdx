Peaceful birth doesn't mean a birth without intensity‚Äîit means creating space where your body feels safe, supported, and free to do what it was designed to do.

### Here are 5 ways to nurture that peace in labor:

- Protect your environment. Soft light, quiet voices, familiar smells‚Äîyour nervous system relaxes in safety, and oxytocin (the hormone that powers contractions) flows best in calm spaces.
- Nourish yourself simply. Light, hydrating foods‚Äîbroths, fruit, herbal teas‚Äîkeep your energy steady for the work ahead.
- Move with instinct. Walk, sway, squat, relax in the tub, curl up to rest‚Äîyour body knows, trust the positions that feel right.
- Breathe with intention. Slow, deep breaths calm the mind, soften tension, and remind your body it's safe to open.
- Anchor with affirmations. Words of strength‚Äî"My body was made for this"‚Äîquiet fear, lower stress, and reconnect you to your power.

Every birth is unique, but peace is always possible when birth is respected, choices are honored, and mamas are deeply supported.
