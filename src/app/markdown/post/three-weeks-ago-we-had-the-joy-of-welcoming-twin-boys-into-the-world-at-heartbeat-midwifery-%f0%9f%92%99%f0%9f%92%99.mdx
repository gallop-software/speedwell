Their amazing mama drove all night from Colorado in early labor, trusting her journey and her body every step of the way. Baby A arrived first at 7lbs 5ozâ€”and then came his little brother, Baby B, at 5lbs 3oz in a breech birth, born safely and beautifully into loving hands. âœ¨Two strong babies. One powerful mother. An incredibly unified family. A birth story we'll hold close for a long time.
