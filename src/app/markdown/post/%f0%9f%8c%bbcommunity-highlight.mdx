Woven photo Elise Hurst is a Lubbock local photographer who specializes in maternity, family, birth and newborn photos. She also serves mothers as a doula.‚ÄúI have been a birth photographer since 2015, right after my second son was born! You could say the birth of my sons spurred me on to actually start my business, but birth work has been deeply planted in my heart since childhood. Photography has always been in my blood since I grew up with a dad who was a full-time photographer. Not only was I the subject of many his photography classes, but he also taught me (and continues to) the love of this art form and all the skill that comes with it! Now I love to weave together motherhood stories all the way from your bump to your arms full of children!‚ÄùüçÇElise has generously donated one of her beautiful birth photo packages with film.Come to our grand opening in Raleigh Ave this Saturday for an opportunity to win this amazing giveaway!
