Shortly after birth, your baby will receive a thorough newborn exam to assess their well-being and make sure they‚Äôre adjusting well to life outside the womb. Here‚Äôs what we look for during this important first checkup:1. Apgar Score: This quick and vital assessment helps us evaluate how your baby is doing right after birth. We check five key areas‚ÄîAppearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration‚Äîand assign a score at 1 and 5 minutes after birth.2. Physical Assessment: We‚Äôll carefully assess your baby‚Äôs appearance, including skin color, posture, and reflexes, while monitoring their heart rate, breathing, and temperature.3. Head and Body Checks: We examine your baby‚Äôs head, eyes, ears, and mouth, ensuring there are no abnormalities. We‚Äôll also observe muscle tone, movement, and strength to make sure your baby‚Äôs body is developing properly.4. Gestational Age Assessment: Using a combination of physical and neurological checks, we estimate your baby‚Äôs gestational age to understand their growth and development.This exam is a key part of your baby‚Äôs early care, and we‚Äôre here to guide you through it every step of the way. As midwives, we work closely with you to support both you and your baby‚Äôs health, helping you feel confident as you begin your journey together. üçºüë∂
