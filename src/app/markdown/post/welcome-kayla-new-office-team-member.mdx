Help us welcome Kayla to the crew! 🧁✨

She's our new office gal, and we're already loving her calm energy and sweet spirit (so naturally, we celebrated her first week with cupcakes 🩷).

Say hi next time you stop by — we're so glad she's here!

Fun fact: we now have TWO gals named "Kayla" at Heartbeat. It has already been so fun to watch their heads turn when we call one of their name's. 😂
