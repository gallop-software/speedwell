When Shiane stepped away at the end of August, there was a lot of logistics to work out since Heartbeat would be down to one midwife with students. Every time I got in the car, my mind was driven to the song Jireh and it was on constant repeat every day…“I’ll never be more loved than I am right now. Wasn’t holding you up so there’s nothing I can do to let you down… going through a storm, but I won’t go down. I hear Your voice carried in the rhythm of the wind to call me out. You would cross an ocean so I wouldn’t drown. You’ve never closer than You are right now. Jireh, You are enough, and I will be content in every circumstance. I don’t want to forget how I feel right now on the mountain top I can see so clearly what it’s all about. So stay by my side till the sun goes down. Jireh, You are enough. Forever enough. Always enough. I’m already chosen. I know who I am. I know what You’ve spoken. I’m already loved more than I could imagine… and that is enough. So I am enough. Jireh, You are enough…More than you ask think or imagine according to His power working in us, it’s more than enough.”As I listened to these words over and over I began to wonder what Jireh meant. I knew it was a name of God but what part of Him did it represent? Jireh - MY Provider. It is timeless encompassing of Gods provision in the past, in the present, and in the future, I have been speechless in wonder at the provision and constant reminder Heartbeat has been given every day.[See Full Post on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DC53sSSBBjt/?img_index=1)
