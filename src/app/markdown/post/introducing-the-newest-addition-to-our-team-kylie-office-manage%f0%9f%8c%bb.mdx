Kylie will be taking over as office manager as Kaegan transitions to student midwife. She has two sweet girls of her own, Emrie Kay (4) and Macy Jo (2) and can’t imagine life without them!“I love spending time with my own family, and now I get to encourage other families as they grow! Each and every pregnancy and path is beautiful and truly a blessing from God. I can’t wait for the opportunity to pray for and serve expecting families during this adventure.”
