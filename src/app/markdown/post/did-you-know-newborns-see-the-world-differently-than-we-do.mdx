At birth, a babyâ€™s vision is blurry, and they can only focus on objects 8-12 inches away â€“ the perfect distance for gazing at their parents during cuddles and feedings. ðŸ’•Their eyes may also appear puffy or have a unique color that changes over the first few months. By about 2 months, babies start tracking movement, and by 3 months, theyâ€™ll begin recognizing familiar faces.Every little milestone is a wonder!
