I love watching families grow, and it is so bittersweet to announce that I will be leaving Heartbeat Midwifery in two weeks to watch my own family continue to grow. I‚Äôll be heading back to MN to help with my two little sisters as they are expecting babies in the fall and winter.Thank you to my coworkers for teaching me so much, and especially thank you to the amazing clients and families who have trusted me with such a sacred season and for the countless things I have learned from you. I hope to be back for visits in the future! Keep in touch! ü§ç -Amber
