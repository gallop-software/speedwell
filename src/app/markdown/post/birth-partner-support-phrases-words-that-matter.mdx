Birth isn't something you get through ‚Äî it's something you move with.

The voice you hear beside you can make all the difference.

But, let's be real‚Ä¶ sometimes it feels intimidating to know what to say. You don't want to say the wrong thing, or you worry you won't have the right words when they're needed most. That's normal.

Here are some grounding, helpful tools your partner can keep in their pocket! Simple words of love, safety, and presence ‚Äî because sometimes just showing up with steady encouragement is everything.

‚Ä¢ You're doing so well.<br/> ‚Ä¢ You're so strong.<br/> ‚Ä¢ We're getting closer to meeting our baby.<br/> ‚Ä¢ I can see how powerful you are, keep going.<br/> ‚Ä¢ Focus on my voice, we're doing this together.<br/> ‚Ä¢ You're safe, I'm right here with you.<br/> ‚Ä¢ One contraction at a time, you're doing great.<br/> ‚Ä¢ I'm so proud of how you're handling this.<br/> ‚Ä¢ Lean on me whenever you need.<br/> ‚Ä¢ I love you, you're doing so well.<br/> ‚Ä¢ I've got you. You're safe with me.<br/> ‚Ä¢ Feel my hand? I'm with you in this.
