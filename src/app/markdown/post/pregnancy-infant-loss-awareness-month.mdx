At Heartbeat Midwifery, we hold sacred space for every family who has loved and lost. To the mothers whose babies live in heaven ‚Äî we see you. To the hearts that ache in silence ‚Äî we honor your story. To the little ones who never took a breath earthside ‚Äî your lives matter. You are remembered. You are not alone. Your grief is sacred. And your baby is forever part of your motherhood. ü§çIf you feel led, we invite you to share your baby's name, a due date, or a symbol that reminds you of them in the comments. Let us hold space together ‚Äî in love, in remembrance, and in quiet strength. Their heartbeat may be still, but their presence is not forgotten. With love and heavy hearts, The Heartbeat family.
