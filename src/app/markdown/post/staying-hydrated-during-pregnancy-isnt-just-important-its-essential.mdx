Proper hydration supports your body in so many ways: helping with digestion, reducing swelling, and keeping your energy up throughout the day. Did you know that drinking enough water also helps with amniotic fluid production and supports your growing baby's health? Aim for 8-10 glasses a day (more if you're active or it's hot outside!). Keep a water bottle handy, and take a sip whenever you can ‚Äî your body (and baby) will thank you!Bonus Tip: Add a slice of lemon, cucumber, or some fresh mint for a refreshing twist on your water.üçã
