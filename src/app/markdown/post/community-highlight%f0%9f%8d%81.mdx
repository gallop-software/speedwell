Illeatha ‚ÄúRed‚Äù Adams NurturingDove Doula Services‚ÄúI am a Doula and mother of 4. My passion has always been working with children, starting at age 12, in my church nursery on Sunday mornings. I ran an in home daycare for 9 years, and learned so many valuable skills working with infants before becoming a Postpartum Doula in 2018. This work soon proved to be a serious love of mine, and quickly followed with Birth doula training, and a serious passion for birth, as well!Being able to help families navigate from pregnancy through the postpartum recovery period has given me the opportunity to grow as a Doula and expand my knowledge and understanding even more. My goal as a Doula is to bring harmony and peace of mind to your pregnancy, birth, and postpartum journey as a family!‚ÄùIlleatha has generously donated: -2 gifts of $200 off of birth doula services and a postpartum package -2 gifts of a free at home lactation visitJoin us for the grand opening party this Saturday and enter to win one of these sweet gifts!
