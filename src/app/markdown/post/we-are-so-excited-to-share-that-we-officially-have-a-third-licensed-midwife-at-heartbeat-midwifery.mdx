Many of you have gotten a chance to meet Kayla as one of our student midwives, but soon youâ€™ll come to know her as our latest licensed midwife!

Kayla has been pursuing midwifery since 2017. She took a small gap within these years to get married and have two children of her own. She came back to midwifery in April 2024 and officially graduated two weeks ago and received her official NARM license last week.

Way to go, Kayla, and welcome as an official staff member at Heartbeat.
