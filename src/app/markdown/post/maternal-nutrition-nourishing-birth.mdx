What you eat in pregnancy does more than fuel you â€” it builds the foundation for your baby's growth and your strength in birth.
Balanced nutrition helps regulate blood sugar, supports stable energy, and gives your body the minerals it needs for strong contractions and effective pushing. Protein supports tissue repair, complex carbs sustain energy through labor, and healthy fats feed both the brain and the hormones that guide birth.
When the body is well-nourished, the uterus works more efficiently, recovery is smoother, and both mom and baby benefit long after birth day.
