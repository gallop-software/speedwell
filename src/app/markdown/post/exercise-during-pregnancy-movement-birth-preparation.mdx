Movement in pregnancy isn't always about hitting fitness goals ‚Äî it's about preparing the body for the work of birth.

Gentle activity like walking, stretching, yoga, or squats improves circulation, eases muscle tension, and encourages baby into an optimal position for labor.

Exercise also plays an important role in the brain and body connection. Moving releases endorphins ‚Äî the body's natural pain-relievers ‚Äî which reduce stress and help keep labor hormones flowing smoothly. This balance is key for shorter, more efficient labors and for maintaining calm, grounded energy throughout the process. üåø

Think of exercise not as a chore, but as intentional preparation. Each stretch, each breath, each step is strengthening the body's ability to do what it was designed to do: birth powerfully and naturally. ü§ç
