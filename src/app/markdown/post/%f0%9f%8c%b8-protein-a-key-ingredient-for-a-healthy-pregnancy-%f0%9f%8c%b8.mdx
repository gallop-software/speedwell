Expecting a little one? Your body is working overtime to support your growing baby, and protein is one of the essential nutrients you don’t want to overlook! 💪 Why is protein so important during pregnancy? Protein helps build and repair tissues, including your baby’s muscles, organs, and immune system. It’s also vital for the development of the placenta, and it can support your body’s increased blood volume. 🙌 👶 How much protein do you need? During pregnancy, you should aim for 70-100 grams of protein per day, depending on your health and activity levels. But don’t worry—getting enough is easier than you think! 🥚🥜🍗 Protein-rich foods to include in your diet: Lean meats (chicken, turkey, beef) Fish (like salmon or tuna) 🐟 Eggs 🥚 Legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas) 🌱 Nuts & seeds 🥜 Greek yogurt 🍨 Keep your meals balanced with a variety of protein sources, and remember, you’re nourishing two people now! 💖 If you have questions about your pregnancy nutrition, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to support you every step of the way! 🌼
