Emily ErringtonEmily is a DONA certified birth doula who has been serving Lubbock mommas for a year and a half.“I graduated from Texas Tech in 2014 but didn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;have a clear vision of what my career path would be. I’ve always loved birth and serving others and after having my second baby I was called into the birthing space. Serving the Lubbock community by supporting families entering this new season of life has been a joy, and a blessing! I strive to help new families feel empowered, educated and loved during their labor, delivery and beyond!”Emily generously donated a mama spa basket in honor of our grand opening💫 The lucky winners of all our giveaways will be announced this afternoon! For privacy, individuals will be contacted if they won.
