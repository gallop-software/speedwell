From the moment they're born, they are instinctively drawn to the smell of their mama for comfort, warmth, and security. This beautiful connection happens during those early moments of skin-to-skin contact, where your baby can begin to recognize your unique scent - and it helps strengthen your bond.So, embrace those first precious hours together, and know that your presence is already everything your baby needs.
