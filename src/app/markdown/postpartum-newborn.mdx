          Gentle, Ongoing Support After Birth
        </Heading>
        <Paragraph>At Heartbeat Midwifery, postpartum care begins the moment your baby's first breath fills the room. We honor this sacred time by centering rest, healing, and deep connection in the days and weeks that follow. Your first visit unfolds in the quiet comfort of your own home—where your body can settle, your heart can breathe, and your midwife can lovingly check on your healing, answer your questions, and celebrate the rhythms of your new baby.</Paragraph>
