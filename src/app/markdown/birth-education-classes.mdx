        <Quote>Birth isn't just something you do—it's something you step into with your whole heart.</Quote>
        <Paragraph>At Heartbeat Midwifery, our birthing classes are more than just lessons. They're a space to gather, to connect, and to grow in confidence as you prepare for one of life's most sacred transitions. Whether you're a first-time parent or simply craving a more connected experience this time around, these classes are a grounding, beautiful way to prepare—together.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Rooted in connection and calm, our birthing classes are thoughtfully designed to nurture both your knowledge and your nervous system. They're included as part of your standard care and held in a cozy, family-friendly space where questions are welcome, laughter is common, and no one is rushed.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>You'll be surrounded by support, encouraged to trust your body, and equipped with tools—both practical and emotional—that help you move through labor feeling steady, informed, and empowered. It's a space to learn, to soften, and to remember that you don't have to walk this path alone.</Paragraph>
