    The Benefits of Water Birth
  </Heading>
  <Paragraph>Research shows that warm water immersion during labor can reduce stress hormones, improve circulation, and promote effective uterine contractions. These effects often result in less physical tension, decreased perception of pain, and a more relaxed state—ideal for those seeking a low-intervention, natural birth. Many birthing parents find that water helps them stay grounded, move freely, and cope with contractions more comfortably.</Paragraph>
