      <Quote>We had both our babies at heartbeat and could not recommend it enough! The midwives took such good care of us and welcomed us with open arms! Sofi always greeted us with a smile and a positive attitude! They made us feel like family! Carmen and Kelly delivered my last baby and it was such a peaceful experience. These ladies really care for their patients! We hope to be back for our next baby!</Quote>

      <Quote>The people at Heartbeat Midwifery are the sweetest ladies ever, so kind and considerate and were there for every question and concern I had. They were so helpful in giving advice on supplements to take and what foods to eat to support my pregnancy and birth and it made a huge difference! At my birth they were so reassuring and knew exactly what they were doing and I have never felt so seen and cared for. My baby was born beautiful and healthy and that is thanks to them. As a first time Mom I couldn't have done this without all of their great support! I would 100% recommend then to anyone!</Quote>

      <Quote>All 3 of our babies have been born at Heartbeat along with Heartbeat helping us through a loss. Carmen and all the other amazing midwives and students that have seen their way through Heartbeat have been a part of each of our incredible journeys. We are beyond thankful for the relationships made while bringing our babies earth side. We are thankful for the support beyond just pregnancy and birth. We can't recommend Heartbeat enough. I know that had we not had the support from a very knowledgeable and experienced midwife my birthing experiences would've been much different.</Quote>

      <Quote>We absolutely loved our experience at Heartbeat. Each prenatal appointment leading up to the birth I felt 100% supported and cared for. As a first time mom, I had lots of questions, and they were so gracious to answer every one and never make me feel bad about asking so many. Their entire staff is warm and welcoming. I was lucky enough to have Carmen, Shianne, and Ellie at my birth at one point, and they all made me feel safe and supported! Their intentional care continued through the several appointments I had postpartum as well! If we are in the Lubbock area for baby #2, we will absolutely use Heartbeat again.</Quote>
