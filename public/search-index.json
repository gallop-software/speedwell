They created a workspace that is modern, functional, and inspiring. The open floor plan encourages collaboration while private offices and meeting rooms provide quiet spaces when needed. Their understanding of commercial design requirements, including lighting, acoustics, and ergonomics, was impressive. The project stayed within budget and minimal disruption to our operations. Employee satisfaction has noticeably improved, and our clients consistently comment on how professional and welcoming our space feels.",

They truly listened to what we wanted and needed, rather than pushing their own agenda. Their design proposals were creative yet practical, beautiful yet livable. The project management was outstanding with clear timelines, regular communication, and problem-solving when unexpected issues arose. The craftsmanship of the work they coordinated was top-notch. Our home is now the envy of our neighborhood, but more importantly, it works perfectly for how we actually live. This was money well spent, and we look forward to working with them again.",

We meticulously restored original details including geometric moldings, terrazzo floors, and brass fixtures, while introducing period-appropriate elements where originals were lost. The color palette of black, gold, emerald, and cream evokes the elegance of the 1920s and 30s.Custom furniture pieces feature the bold geometric patterns and luxurious materials characteristic of the era, including lacquered wood, velvet upholstery, and mirrored surfaces. We sourced vintage light fixtures and commissioned reproductions of iconic Art Deco designs. For more historic preservation work, see our Historic Brownstone Revival. Modern conveniences like updated plumbing, electrical, and HVAC were seamlessly integrated behind the restored architecture. The result is a stunning example of period design that functions beautifully for contemporary living. Our Boutique Hotel Design showcases similar attention to historic detail in a commercial setting.Restoration projects like this one require extensive research into period-appropriate materials, techniques, and design vocabulary. We consulted historical archives, worked with specialty craftspeople, and sourced vintage pieces from estate sales and antique dealers. This same dedication to authenticity and curated collecting informed our library study design, where every detail contributes to a cohesive, timeless atmosphere."
